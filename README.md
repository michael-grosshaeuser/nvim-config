# nvim-config


## Required OS packages

For openSUSE based installation run command:
```bash
zypper in ripgrep fd
```

## Setup

On Linux the directory is `~/.config/nvim`.
First, we need to remove all the files under the config directory (including dot files),
then go to this directory, and run the following command:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/michael-grosshaeuser/nvim-config.git .
```
